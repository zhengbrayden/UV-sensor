Code for my UV-sensor project

Overview
The UV sensor scans across 180 degrees on two axes, detecting the direction with the highest UV radiation. The device then positions itself to face that direction, and the UV value is displayed on a 7-segment LED display. This project was developed using an STM32 microcontroller and a quantifiable test plan to ensure both energy efficiency and functional accuracy, making it a reliable embedded system for real-time UV monitoring.
